This repository contains sample(s) for connecting Arduino devices to the IBM Internet of Things Foundation with a DHT22 sensor.
I include all the libraries needed to run out of the box this sketch.
Just connect the DHT22 to digital pin 2.


THINGS TO MUST MODIFY IN THE CODE TO MAKE IT WORKS WITH YOUR BLUEMIX REGISTERED DEVICES:


#define CLIENT_ID "d:YOUR_BLUEMIX_ORGANIZATION:YOUR_DEVICE_HERE:MAC_HERE"
#define MS_PROXY "YOUR_BLUEMIX_ORGANIZATION.messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com"
#define AUTHTOKEN "BLUEMIX PASSWORD OF THE DEVICES HERE"




********just works with registered devices in bluemix.
